# Web Scraping Project in Python

This is a Python project for web scraping, a technique used to extract data from websites. In this project, we will provide a basic structure and guidelines for building a web scraping application using Python. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to scrape data from websites of your choice.

## Project Overview

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, and it can be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, research, or automation. This project provides a basic framework to get you started with web scraping in Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.6 or higher) installed on your system.
- Python libraries:
  - [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
  - [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraper.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd web-scraper
```

## Usage

1. Customize the web scraping code in the `scraper.py` file to suit your needs. You can modify the URL to the website you want to scrape and adapt the data extraction logic.
2. Run the `scraper.py` script to initiate the web scraping process:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

3. The scraped data will be saved to a file or printed to the console, depending on your code implementation.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `scraper.py`: The main Python script for web scraping.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries required for this project.
